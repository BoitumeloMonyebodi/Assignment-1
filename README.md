#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 

Software engineering is the process of designing ,testing ,developing and maintenance of software applications.The importance of software engineering in the technology industry is that it provides a structured approach to the principles of software engineering that meet the evolving of business needs of businesses and users allowing them to optimize operations and manage data effectively ,apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users .


2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. 

●Software engineering coined=The term was first used in the 1960s at a NATO conference ,marking the formal recognition of software development as a distinct discipline.
●Internet and Web technologies=Introduced in the 1990s.The rise of the internet significantly impacted software development with new technologies like HTML,Javascript and distributed systems.
●DevOps=Introduced in the 2000s.DevOps practices integrated development and operations ,promoting faster software delivery and continuous feedback.

3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

●Planning=This phase is all about defining the product,planning for the launch and establishing clear requirements.
●Coding=This phase is all about developing and coding the product.
●Design=This phase is all about building the framework.
●Testing=This phase is all about testing the product to ensure it meets the required standards.
●Requirement analysis=This phase is all about analyzing the requirements for the product.
●Deployment=This phase is all about implementing and deploying the product.
●Maintenance=This phase is all about maintaining the product and performing ongoing improvements.

4.Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodologies =is a linear and sequential model,which means that it is a development phase that cannot begin until the previous phase is completed .We cannot overlap phases in this methodology.
E.g Large-scale government=Developing complex government software systems with strict procurement processes and detailed specifications where changes during development are highly discouraged .
●Agile methodologies=Allows companies to develop and release software changes in small segments on a frequent basis.
E.g Rapid response to market changes=When market conditions or competitor actions require quick adjustments to the product .Agile allows for flexible adaptation.

5.Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team

●Software developer=is primarily responsible for writing codes,designing software architecture,implementing features and ensuring the functionality of a software product by collaborating with other team members, designers,testers and product managers while adhering to established development methodologies and best practices.The role of a software developer is to analyze users’ needs ,design and meet those needs.Recommend software upgrades for customers’ existing programs and systems etc.
●Quality Assurance engineer=is responsible for designing,executing and analyzing tests to ensure the quality of software applications by identifying defects,validating functionality and collaborating with developers to deliver high quality products.The role of a quality assurance engineer is to design ,test plans ,scenarios,scripts and procedures.
●Product Manager=Is responsible for the strategic planning,execution and success of a software product ensuring it meets users’ needs and business goals.The role of a product manager includes helping the team to design,monitor and finish their work. 


6.Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

●Integrated Development Environments(IDEs)=is a software application in the software development process that helps programmers develop software codes efficiently.
E.g PyCharm is a specialized IDE for Python development known for it’s advanced code analysis and refactoring features.
●Version Control Systems(VCS)= allows developers to track changes made to code over time ,enabling them to revert to previous if needed ,collaborate effectively on projects and manage different development streams through branching.
E.g Git=The most popular distributed version control system offering fast and flexible workflows with features like branching and merging.

7.What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

●Rapid Technological Advancements=This can be overcomed by dedicating time to learning new technologies and staying updated on industry trends .
●Collaboration issues=This can be overcomed by fostering a collaborative environment where team members can share knowledge and support each other.
●UnManageable complex codebases, changing project requirements ,security issues and burnouts=These challenges can be overcomed by adopting robust development methodologies,utilizing version control systems,implementing safe security measures and prioritizing work-life balance.

8.Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

●Unit testing=is a software testing process for testing specific units ,components and software elements. It’s importance in software quality assurance is helping identify bugs and issues at an early stage of the software development cycle.
●Integration testing=is when different software components and modules are combined and tested as a group to make sure everything is ready for the next level. It’s importance is to prevent critical failures in production by addressing bugs before deployment.
●System testing=inspects components like performance ,load,reliability and security with the goal of evaluating the end-to-end system specification. It’s importance offers visibility into the stability of a product at every stage of development.
●Acceptance testing=It’s conducted by the user or customer since the goal is to find out if the requirement have been met on delivery of the final product




#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1.Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering=is the process of writing instructions to get the best results from generative AI models.The importance of interacting with AI models is to help improve response relevance,ensure clarity,controls tone,saves time, reduces errors and maximizes the model’s capabilities.It also helps users achieve better outcomes with their AI interactions.

2.Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt=”Help me with my project.”

Improved Prompt=”I’m working on a school project about the phases of the business cycle .Can you help me outline the key causes and consequences of global shifts that influence the length and severity of each phase?”
The improved prompt is more effective because it:
•Narrows the focus,making the question clearer and more specific
•Removes ambiguity ,reducing the chance of a misunderstanding or overly general answer.
